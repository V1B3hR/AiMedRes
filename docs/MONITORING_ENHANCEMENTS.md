## Usage Examples

### Performance Analyzer
```python
from security.performance_monitor import ClinicalPerformanceMonitor, PerformanceAnalyzer

monitor = ClinicalPerformanceMonitor()
monitor.start_monitoring()

# Configure monitoring
monitor.set_monitoring_interval(0.5)

# Record metrics
monitor.record_operation('ai_inference', 45, ClinicalPriority.URGENT)

# Analyze trends
analyzer = PerformanceAnalyzer(monitor)
trends = analyzer.analyze_trends(hours_back=24)
risk = analyzer.predict_violation_risk(hours_ahead=1)
```

### Alert Deduplication
```python
from security.monitoring import AlertDeduplicator

deduplicator = AlertDeduplicator(dedup_window_seconds=300)

# First alert is sent
if deduplicator.should_send_alert('failed_auth', {'user': 'john'}):
    send_alert(...)

# Duplicate within 5 minutes is suppressed
if deduplicator.should_send_alert('failed_auth', {'user': 'john'}):
    send_alert(...)  # This won't execute
```

### Advanced Drift Detection
```python
from mlops.monitoring.drift_detection import ImagingDriftDetector

detector = ImagingDriftDetector(drift_features=['feature1', 'feature2'])
detector.fit_baseline(baseline_data)

# Strict mode for sensitive detection
results = detector.detect_drift(new_data, strict_mode=True)

# PSI calculation
psi_results = detector.detect_drift_with_multiple_methods(
    new_data, 
    methods=['population_stability']
)

# Feature importance
importance = detector.get_feature_importance()

# Export report
detector.export_drift_report('drift_report.json', include_history=True)
```

### Drift Recovery Automation
```python
from mlops.monitoring.drift_detection import DriftRecoveryManager

recovery = DriftRecoveryManager()
drift_results = detector.detect_drift(new_data)

# Automatic recovery actions
recovery_result = recovery.handle_drift_event(drift_results, detector)

# View actions taken
print(f"Actions: {recovery_result['actions_taken']}")
print(f"Severity: {recovery_result['drift_severity']}")
```
