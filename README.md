# duetmind_adaptive

## What is duetmind_adaptive?

**duetmind_adaptive** is an advanced AI research project focused on simulating adaptive neural networks and multi-agent systems for medical decision-making. It integrates biological state simulation (energy, sleep, mood), multi-agent dialogue, and real-world data to model and understand complex brain diseases.

## Purpose

The purpose of duetmind_adaptive is to accelerate research and development of AI-driven solutions for neurodegenerative and mental health conditions. By leveraging adaptive neural architectures and agent-based collaboration, this project aims to create tools and frameworks that enhance understanding of disease mechanisms and improve clinical decision support.

## Goal

The primary goal is to deepen our understanding of diseases affecting the brain—such as Alzheimer's, stroke, and other neurological disorders—and to develop better solutions for diagnosis, monitoring, and intervention. duetmind_adaptive strives to answer critical questions about disease progression and treatment by:
- Simulating biological and cognitive states
- Enabling collaborative reasoning among medical AI agents
- Supporting data-driven decision-making in clinical settings
- Facilitating real-time monitoring and explainable AI for clinicians

Ultimately, the project seeks to find new ways to fight brain diseases and contribute to improved patient outcomes.

## Migration Notes

### File Structure Updates 

**Important**: The project file structure has been reorganized. If you have existing code that imports from the old paths, please update your imports:

#### Updated Import Paths:
- **Old**: `from training.alzheimer_training_system import ...`
- **New**: `from files.training.alzheimer_training_system import ...`

#### Files Updated:
- Training modules are now located in `files/training/` directory
- All references to `training.*` imports have been updated to `files.training.*`
- Documentation and examples have been updated with correct import paths

#### For Developers:
If you encounter import errors like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'training.alzheimer_training_system'`, update your imports to use the new path structure:

```python
# Old import (will fail)
from training.alzheimer_training_system import load_alzheimer_data

# New import (correct)
from files.training.alzheimer_training_system import load_alzheimer_data
```
