# ALS Progression Prediction Training Pipeline

This document outlines the structure and functionality of the training pipeline for ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) progression prediction.

## Overview

The `train_als.py` script provides a framework for training machine learning models to predict the progression of ALS based on patient data. This is currently a placeholder and will be expanded with full functionality.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Data Loading**: Support for loading ALS clinical trial datasets.
- **Preprocessing**: Handling of specific features related to ALS, such as ALSFRS-R scores and FVC measurements.
- **Model Training**: Training of both classical machine learning models and neural networks for regression or classification tasks.
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics for prediction performance.

## Usage

```bash
python training/train_als.py --data-path /path/to/your/dataset.csv --epochs 50
```
