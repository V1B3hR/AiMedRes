## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Training
```bash
# Default training with 20 epochs
python train_cardiovascular.py

# Specific dataset choice
python train_cardiovascular.py --dataset-choice cardiovascular-prediction --epochs 20
python train_cardiovascular.py --dataset-choice cardiovascular-disease --epochs 20
```

### Demonstration
```bash
# Complete demonstration of both datasets
python demo_cardiovascular_training.py
```

### Integration with Existing Systems
```bash
# All systems now use 20 epochs consistently
python train_alzheimers.py --epochs 20
python train_diabetes.py --epochs 20
python train_cardiovascular.py --epochs 20
```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Neural Network Architecture
- **CardiovascularMLPClassifier**: Specialized for cardiovascular features
- **4 hidden layers**: 256 → 128 → 64 → 32 neurons
- **Batch normalization** and **dropout** for regularization
- **20 epochs** training with early stopping

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Automatic feature detection**: Numeric vs categorical features
- **Medical domain optimization**: Cardiovascular-specific preprocessing
- **Robust data loading**: Multiple CSV format support
- **Sample data generation**: Fallback when Kaggle unavailable
