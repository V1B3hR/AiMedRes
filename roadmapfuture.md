---

## Foundation & Core System
- âœ… Adaptive neural network architecture designed, tested, documented
- âœ… Multi-agent dialogue framework implemented, tested, documented
- âœ… Basic biological state simulation (energy, sleep, mood)
- âœ… Initial Alzheimer's dataset integration (see scripts/enhanced_kaggle_loader.py)
- âœ… Project structure reorganization (`files/training/` migration, 95% complete)
- âœ… Stable core architecture with performance tests (~150ms, optimizing)
- âœ… Documentation overhaul with updated examples

## Core Infrastructure & Import Paths
- ðŸŸ§ Import path migration to `files.training.*` (95% complete, legacy scan ongoing)
- ðŸŸ§ Core engine stabilization (<100ms target, currently ~150ms; optimization active)
- ðŸŸ§ Training pipeline enhancement (Alzheimer's preprocessing, validation framework, cross-validation, ongoing data expansion/testing)

## Clinical Integration & Validation
- ðŸŸ§ EHR integration protocol (FHIR/HL7) finalized, API security in progress
- ðŸŸ§ Explainable AI dashboard deployment (prototype built, clinical workflow integration ongoing)
- ðŸŸ§ Real-time patient monitoring system (active development)
- ðŸŸ¥ Initial clinical pilot programs (missing)
- ðŸŸ¥ Regulatory compliance documentation (not started)

## Production Deployment & Scale
- ðŸŸ¥ FDA regulatory pathway initiation (documentation/tests partial, not complete)
- ðŸŸ¥ Multi-hospital clinical validation (missing)
- ðŸŸ§ Advanced AI safety monitoring (core implemented, advanced features in progress)
- ðŸŸ§ Production infrastructure scaling (multi-region, auto-scaling scripts present, backup/disaster recovery ongoing)
- ðŸŸ§ Research publication/dissemination (missing)

## Advanced Features & Research
- ðŸŸ¦ Python version inconsistency (pyproject.toml vs setup.py) â€“ needs alignment
- ðŸŸ¦ Package name standardization (`duetmind-adaptive` vs `duetmind_adaptive`) â€“ needs alignment
- ðŸŸ¥ Expanded disease coverage (Parkinson's, ALS, etc.) â€“ missing
- âœ… Advanced memory consolidation algorithms â€“ implemented, tested, documented
- ðŸŸ¥ 3D brain visualization tools â€“ missing
- ðŸŸ¥ Custom agent behavior API â€“ missing
- ðŸŸ¥ Mobile clinical companion app â€“ missing
- ðŸŸ¥ Drug discovery/clinical trial support modules â€“ missing

## Testing, Documentation, & Contributions
- âœ… Comprehensive pytest test suite present and documented
- ðŸŸ§ Ongoing test/data expansion and validation
- âœ… GitHub Issues and PR workflow enabled
- âœ… Contributing docs (see CONTRIBUTING.md) for code, documentation, and testing
