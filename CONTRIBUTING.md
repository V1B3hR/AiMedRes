## üè• Medical Contribution Guidelines

### Clinical Validation
- All medical algorithms must include clinical validation
- Provide peer-reviewed references for medical claims
- Include appropriate disclaimers about clinical use
- Follow FDA/regulatory guidelines where applicable

### Data Privacy & Security
- Follow HIPAA, GDPR, and other privacy regulations

- Implement proper de-identification techniques

### Medical Standards Compliance
- Support standard medical formats (DICOM, NIfTI, HL7)
- Follow medical coding standards (ICD-10, SNOMED CT)
- Ensure interoperability with existing medical systems

## üìã Development Process

### 1. Choose an Issue
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
- For major features, discuss the approach first

### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 3. Development Standards
- **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8, use Black for formatting
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for all new functionality
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings and update relevant docs
- **Commits**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages

### 4. Testing Requirements
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/        # Unit tests
pytest tests/integration/ # Integration tests
pytest tests/regression/  # Regression tests
```

### 5. Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Format code
black .

# Check style
flake8 .

# Type checking (optional but recommended)
mypy .
```

## üî¨ Testing Guidelines

### Medical Algorithm Testing
- Include validation against established benchmarks
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Validate clinical accuracy metrics
- Test with diverse demographic data

### Data Quality Testing
- Validate input data formats
- Test data preprocessing pipelines
- Check for data leakage in train/test splits
- Verify de-identification effectiveness

### Performance Testing
- Benchmark training and inference times
- Test memory usage and scalability
- Validate distributed computing features
- Test production deployment scenarios

## üìñ Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
```python
def analyze_medical_image(image_path: str, model_type: str = "cnn") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze medical imaging data for diagnostic insights.
    
    Args:
        image_path: Path to medical image file (DICOM, NIfTI, etc.)
        model_type: Type of model to use ("cnn", "transformer", "hybrid")
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results with confidence scores
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If image format is not supported
        FileNotFoundError: If image file doesn't exist
        
    Example:
        >>> result = analyze_medical_image("brain_mri.dcm", "cnn")
        >>> print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2f}")
    """
```
