DEPENDENCY / SEQUENCING NOTES

Foundational First: P1–P4 remove tech debt and stabilize baseline before scaling performance & compliance steps rely on consistent architecture.
Security & Compliance Early: P5 + partial P6 security tasks prevent costly retrofits later.
Clinical Readiness: P6–P8 feed evidence required for P9 FDA pathway.
Reg + Safety Pre-Scale: P9 and P11 precede large-scale multi-hospital (P12).
Scale Before Breadth: P10 (infra) must precede multi-hospital & specialty expansions (P12–P13).
Insight Layer: Memory population insights (P14) can run in parallel with P10 once data pipelines stable.
Visualization & Modules: P15 after stable inference + memory layers for richer data sources.
Long-Horizon R&D: P16–P20 positioned to not block operational go-live.
