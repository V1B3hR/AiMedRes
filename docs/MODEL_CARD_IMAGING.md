### Ethical Considerations
- **Bias**: Potential bias toward certain demographic groups
- **Interpretability**: Limited explainability for clinical decisions
- **Privacy**: Requires careful handling of medical imaging data
- **Validation**: Requires clinical validation before deployment

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Scenarios
- Use in primary diagnostic decision-making
- Application to populations not represented in training
- Use with significantly different imaging protocols
- Deployment without appropriate clinical oversight

### Mitigation Strategies
- Require clinical review of all model outputs
