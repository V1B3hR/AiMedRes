# DuetMind Adaptive Roadmap

1. Foundation & Extensibility
- **Refactor Core Modules:** ✅ Refactor, code maintainability, and structure improvement completed ([PR 72, 75, 76](https://github.com/V1B3hR/duetmind_adaptive/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)).
- **Expand Documentation:** Not fully confirmed; some doc updates, but not comprehensive guides.
- **Improve API Coverage:** Not confirmed done.
- **Testing & QA:** ✅ Advanced rigorous test suite and CI integration ([PR 50, 63](https://github.com/V1B3hR/duetmind_adaptive/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)). CI workflow, coverage reporting, and regression/performance tests added.

2. Multi-Modality & Agents
- **Medical Imaging Expansion:** ✅ DICOM/NIfTI support, BIDS validation ([PR 59, 60, 61](https://github.com/V1B3hR/duetmind_adaptive/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)). Imaging-aware agent integration confirmed.
- **Multi-Agent Enhancements:** ✅ Agent-to-agent communications, explainability, and safety/security systems implemented. Enhanced ConsensusManager with peer review, safety validation, and explainable AI outputs.
- **Clinical Scenario Builder:** ✅ Complete clinical scenario validation system with medical safety rules, contraindication checking, and timeline logic validation.
- **Federated Learning:** ✅ Privacy-preserving federated learning implemented with differential privacy, secure aggregation, and multi-client simulation capabilities.

3. Automation & Scalability 
- **AutoML Integration:** ✅ Complete automated hyperparameter optimization with Optuna, multi-algorithm support, and Bayesian optimization ([Implementation](src/duetmind_adaptive/training/automl.py)).
- **Pipeline Customization:** ✅ Dynamic pipeline builder with flexible preprocessing, custom transformers, and configuration management ([Implementation](src/duetmind_adaptive/training/custom_pipeline.py)).
- **Scalable Orchestration:** ✅ Ray-based workflow orchestration with resource management, task dependencies, and distributed execution ([Implementation](src/duetmind_adaptive/training/orchestration.py)).
- **Drift & Monitoring:** ✅ Enhanced drift monitoring with automated response workflows, multi-channel alerting, and intelligent retraining triggers ([Implementation](src/duetmind_adaptive/training/enhanced_drift_monitoring.py)).

4. Production & Impact
- **Deployment Toolkit:** ✅ Complete production deployment toolkit with Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring, and observability configurations ([Implementation](duetmind.py), [Examples](examples/enterprise_demo.py)).
- **User Experience:** ✅ Comprehensive user experience guide with examples, tutorials, and best practices ([Documentation](docs/USER_EXPERIENCE_GUIDE.md)).
- **Community Contributions:** ✅ Community contribution guidelines and developer resources ([Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
- **Clinical Validation:** ✅ Clinical validation framework with regulatory compliance, safety checks, and validation protocols ([Framework](docs/CLINICAL_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK.md)).

## Ongoing: Maintenance & Iteration
- **Bug Fixes & Stability:** ✅ Multiple bug fixes and repo cleanups ([PRs 69, 71, 72, 75, 76](https://github.com/V1B3hR/duetmind_adaptive/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)).
- **Performance Optimization:** Not confirmed done.
- **Documentation Updates:** Some done ([PR 73](https://github.com/V1B3hR/duetmind_adaptive/pull/73)), but not all guides/API refs confirmed.
- **Security & Compliance:** Not confirmed done.
