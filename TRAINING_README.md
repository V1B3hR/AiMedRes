# Machine Learning Training System for duetmind_adaptive

This module provides a complete machine learning training system that integrates seamlessly with the duetmind_adaptive framework. It enables AI agents to learn from and make predictions on medical datasets, specifically focusing on Alzheimer's disease assessment.

## Features

- **Complete ML Pipeline**: Data loading, preprocessing, training, and model persistence
- **Alzheimer's Disease Focus**: Specialized features for medical assessment
- **Framework Integration**: Seamlessly extends existing UnifiedAdaptiveAgent capabilities
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and testing

## Basic Training Usage

```python
from training import AlzheimerTrainer

# Create trainer
trainer = AlzheimerTrainer()

# Load and preprocess data
df = trainer.load_data()
X, y = trainer.preprocess_data(df)

# Train model
results = trainer.train_model(X, y)

# Save trained model
trainer.save_model("my_model.pkl")
```

## Enhanced Agent Usage

```python
from training import TrainingIntegratedAgent
from labyrinth_adaptive import AliveLoopNode, ResourceRoom

# Create framework components
alive_node = AliveLoopNode((0, 0), (0.1, 0.1), initial_energy=15.0)
resource_room = ResourceRoom()

# Create enhanced agent with ML capabilities
agent = TrainingIntegratedAgent("MedicalAI", {"logic": 0.9}, alive_node, resource_room, trainer)

# Define patient features
patient_features = {
    'age': 75,
    'gender': 'F',
    'education_level': 12,
    'mmse_score': 22,
    'cdr_score': 1.0,
    'apoe_genotype': 'E3/E4'
}

# Enhanced reasoning with ML prediction
result = agent.enhanced_reason_with_ml("Assess patient", patient_features)
print(f"ML Prediction: {result['ml_prediction']}")
```

## Key Classes

### AlzheimerTrainer

Main class for machine learning training and prediction.

**Methods:**
- `load_data()`: Load Alzheimer dataset
- `preprocess_data(df)`: Preprocess data for ML
- `train_model(X, y)`: Train Random Forest classifier
- `save_model(filename)`: Save trained model
- `load_model(filename)`: Load saved model
- `predict(features)`: Make predictions on new data

### TrainingIntegratedAgent

Enhanced agent that combines traditional reasoning with ML predictions.

**Methods:**

- `get_ml_insights()`: Get model information and insights

**Key Features:**
- Extends UnifiedAdaptiveAgent with ML capabilities
- Maintains full compatibility with existing framework
- Combines traditional and ML confidence scores
- Provides detailed prediction insights

## Dataset Features

The system uses the following features for Alzheimer's assessment:

- **age**: Patient age (50-90 years)
- **gender**: Patient gender (M/F)
- **education_level**: Years of education (8-22 years)
- **mmse_score**: Mini-Mental State Examination score (0-30)
- **cdr_score**: Clinical Dementia Rating (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0)
- **apoe_genotype**: APOE genotype (E2/E2, E2/E3, E3/E3, E3/E4, E4/E4)

**Target Classes:**
- Normal: No cognitive impairment
- MCI: Mild Cognitive Impairment
- Dementia: Alzheimer's disease

## Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Features**: 6 processed features (including encoded categorical variables)
- **Classes**: 3 (Normal, MCI, Dementia)
- **Performance**: Typically 90%+ accuracy on test data
- **Key Predictors**: CDR score, MMSE score, age

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_training.py
```

Run the demonstration:

```bash
python demo_training_system.py
```

## Integration with duetmind_adaptive

The training system is designed to work seamlessly with the existing framework:

- **Compatible**: Works with AliveLoopNode, ResourceRoom, MazeMaster
- **Extensible**: TrainingIntegratedAgent extends UnifiedAdaptiveAgent
- **Non-invasive**: No modifications to existing framework code required
- **Flexible**: Can be used independently or as part of larger agent systems

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- Graceful fallbacks when data files are missing
- Automatic sample data generation for testing
- Robust model validation and persistence
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Performance Considerations

- **Small Datasets**: Automatically adjusts training approach for datasets < 20 samples
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses appropriate data types and scaled features
- **Fast Prediction**: Optimized for real-time agent reasoning
- **Caching**: Patient feature vectors can be cached for repeated predictions

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- pickle (built-in)
- logging (built-in)

## File Structure

```
training.py              # Main training system implementation

## Example Output

```
ML Prediction: Dementia
  • Confidence: 0.955
  • All Probabilities: {'Dementia': '0.955', 'MCI': '0.035', 'Normal': '0.010'}

Enhanced Reasoning Details:
