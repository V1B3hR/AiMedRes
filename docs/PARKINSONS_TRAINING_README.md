# Parkinson's Disease Training Pipeline

This document outlines the structure and functionality of the training pipeline for Parkinson's disease classification.

## Overview

The `train_parkinsons.py` script provides a framework for training machine learning models to classify Parkinson's disease based on patient data. This is currently a placeholder and will be expanded with full functionality.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Data Loading**: Support for loading Parkinson's datasets.
- **Preprocessing**: Handling of specific features related to Parkinson's, such as UPDRS scores.
- **Model Training**: Training of both classical machine learning models and neural networks.
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics for classification performance.

## Usage

```bash
python training/train_parkinsons.py --data-path /path/to/your/dataset.csv --epochs 50
```
