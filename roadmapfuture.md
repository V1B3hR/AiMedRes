## Foundation & Core System
- âœ… Adaptive neural network architecture designed, tested, documented
- âœ… Multi-agent dialogue framework implemented, tested, documented
- âœ… Basic biological state simulation (energy, sleep, mood)
- âœ… Initial Alzheimer's dataset integration (see scripts/enhanced_kaggle_loader.py)
- âœ… Project structure reorganization (`files/training/` migration, 99% complete)
- âœ… Stable core architecture with performance tests (~18ms import time, ~99% improvement)
- âœ… Documentation overhaul with updated examples

## Core Infrastructure & Import Paths
- âœ… Import path migration to `files.training.*` (complete; legacy scan finished)
- âœ… Core engine stabilization (<20ms import time achieved)
- âœ… Training pipeline enhancements (Alzheimer's preprocessing, validation, cross-validation protocols active)

## Clinical Integration & Validation
- âœ… EHR integration protocol (FHIR/HL7) finalized, API security implemented
- ðŸŸ§ Explainable AI dashboard deployment (prototype built, clinical workflow integration ongoing)
- ðŸŸ§ Real-time patient monitoring system (active development)
- ðŸŸ§ Initial clinical pilot programs (phase initiated, data collection planned)
- ðŸŸ§ Regulatory compliance documentation (GDPR/FDA docs modules implemented; documentation phase ongoing)

## Production Deployment & Scale
- ðŸŸ§ FDA regulatory pathway initiation (documentation modules implemented, validation in progress)
- ðŸŸ§ Multi-hospital clinical validation (pilot phase initiated, partners onboarding)
- âœ… Advanced AI safety monitoring (comprehensive validation framework operational)
- âœ… Production infrastructure scaling (multi-region, auto-scaling scripts, backup/disaster recovery present)
- ðŸŸ§ Research publication/dissemination (preprints in preparation)

## Advanced Features & Research
- ðŸŸ¦ Python version inconsistency (pyproject.toml vs setup.py) â€“ needs alignment
- ðŸŸ¦ Package name standardization (`duetmind-adaptive` vs `duetmind_adaptive`) â€“ needs alignment
- ðŸŸ§ Expanded disease coverage (Parkinson's, ALS, etc.) â€“ initial modeling planned
- âœ… Advanced memory consolidation algorithms â€“ implemented, tested, documented
- ðŸŸ§ 3D brain visualization tools â€“ prototype in development
- ðŸŸ§ Custom agent behavior API â€“ initial interface designed
- ðŸŸ§ Mobile clinical companion app â€“ design phase started
- ðŸŸ§ Drug discovery/clinical trial support modules â€“ planning underway

## Testing, Documentation, & Contributions
- âœ… Comprehensive pytest test suite present and documented
- âœ… Ongoing test/data expansion and validation
- âœ… GitHub Issues and PR workflow enabled
- âœ… Contributing docs (see CONTRIBUTING.md) for code, documentation, and testing
