# AiMedRes Debugging Process: Phases & Best Practices

Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step debugging process tailored for the AiMedRes repository, with up to 10 phases. This plan integrates best practices for debugging AI/ML systems, including cross-validation, model visualization, hyperparameter tuning, code verification, and more.

---

## PHASE 1: ENVIRONMENT & REPRODUCIBILITY CHECKS ✅ COMPLETE
- **Subphase 1.1:** Verify Python/ML environment setup (package versions, CUDA, etc.) ✅ COMPLETE
- **Subphase 1.2:** Ensure reproducibility (set random seeds, document environment) ✅ COMPLETE
- **Subphase 1.3:** Version control verification ✅ COMPLETE

## PHASE 2: DATA INTEGRITY & PREPROCESSING DEBUGGING Complete
- **Subphase 2.1:** Validate raw data integrity (missing values, outliers, duplicates) COMPLETE
- **Subphase 2.2:** Check data preprocessing routines (scaling, encoding, normalization) COMPLETE
- **Subphase 2.3:** Visualize data distributions & class balance COMPLETE

## PHASE 3: CODE SANITY & LOGICAL ERROR CHECKS
- **Subphase 3.1:** Review code for syntax, import, and logical errors
- **Subphase 3.2:** Confirm correct use of ML libraries and APIs
- **Subphase 3.3:** Validate utility functions (feature engineering, data splitting)

## PHASE 4: MODEL ARCHITECTURE VERIFICATION
- **Subphase 4.1:** Ensure model architecture matches problem needs (avoid under/overfitting)
- **Subphase 4.2:** Start with simple models for baseline (e.g., linear regression, decision tree)
- **Subphase 4.3:** Gradually increase complexity, logging performance changes

## PHASE 5: CROSS-VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION
- **Subphase 5.1:** Use k-fold cross-validation for generalization check
- **Subphase 5.2:** Apply stratified sampling for imbalanced datasets
- **Subphase 5.3:** Optionally, use leave-one-out cross-validation for small datasets

## PHASE 6: HYPERPARAMETER TUNING & SEARCH
- **Subphase 6.1:** Identify key hyperparameters for tuning (learning rate, batch size, etc.)
- **Subphase 6.2:** Use grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization for tuning
- **Subphase 6.3:** Track and visualize tuning results to identify optimal settings

## PHASE 7: MODEL TRAINING & EVALUATION
- **Subphase 7.1:** Train models with cross-validation
- **Subphase 7.2:** Record training, validation, and test metrics (accuracy, loss, etc.)
- **Subphase 7.3:** Compare results with baseline models

## PHASE 8: MODEL VISUALIZATION & INTERPRETABILITY
- **Subphase 8.1:** Generate feature importance plots for tree-based models
- **Subphase 8.2:** Plot partial dependence for key features
- **Subphase 8.3:** Display confusion matrices for classifiers (precision, recall, F1)

## PHASE 9: ERROR ANALYSIS & EDGE CASES
- **Subphase 9.1:** Analyze misclassified samples and residuals
- **Subphase 9.2:** Investigate model bias (e.g., toward certain classes)
- **Subphase 9.3:** Test on edge cases and adversarial examples

## PHASE 10: FINAL MODEL & SYSTEM VALIDATION
- **Subphase 10.1:** Validate model on held-out/test data
- **Subphase 10.2:** Perform end-to-end pipeline tests
- **Subphase 10.3:** Document findings, improvements, and next steps

Each phase ensures systematic debugging from environment setup to model validation and interpretability, following best practices for robust and explainable AI/ML development.
