# GUI Implementation Checklist — Prioritized (Repository‑aware)

Version: 2025-10-24  
Author: GitHub Copilot for V1B3hR/AiMedRes

Purpose
- This file is a prioritized, actionable implementation checklist to build a clinician/researcher‑facing GUI for AiMedRes.
- It is based on a repository‑level analysis (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/, security modules, Phase2B docs, roadmap and archive docs, tests and project structure).
- Each item has: short description, acceptance criteria, rough effort estimate, and repository dependencies (files/dirs to inspect or link to).

How to use
- Create one GitHub issue per checklist item and link the relevant dependency files.
- Use acceptance criteria as gates for PR review and staging signoff.
- Track progress with Epics (see Suggested Epics section).

PRIORITY KEYS
- P0: Blocker — must be finished before any clinical pilot or user‑facing deployment
- P1: High — required for safe early production / constrained pilot
- P2: Medium — reliability, monitoring, compliance features for broader rollout
- P3: Low / Long‑term — advanced features and research integrations

Summary of repository signals used
- Contributor & process docs: CONTRIBUTING.md (clinical, security, PR templates)
- Security & privacy: docs/PHASE2B_README.md, SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md (referenced in docs/INDEX.md), security/ modules
- Regulatory & pilot state: docs/roadmap.md, docs/archive/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_P8B_P9.md, RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md
- APIs & code layout: src/aimedres/api, src/aimedres/clinical, src/aimedres/security, docs/API_REFERENCE.md (referenced)
- Tests: tests/unit/test_security, tests integration harness (referenced)

!!COMPLETED!!
P0 — Blockers (legal, privacy, security, gating)
- P0-1: Confirm authoritative LICENSE and legal distribution terms  
  - Acceptance: LICENSE file matches stated license in repo and setup.py; README and packaging metadata updated; legal signoff tracked in an issue.  
  - Effort: 0.5 day.  
  - Dependencies: LICENSE, README.md, setup.py.
- P0-2: Explicit clinical use classification + UI disclaimers / labeling  
  - Acceptance: UI mockups & About page include “research only / not a diagnostic device” text; README and RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md align; product labeling agreed with legal/clinical lead.  
  - Effort: 0.5–1 day.  
  - Dependencies: README.md, docs/archive/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_P8B_P9.md.
- P0-3: PHI de‑identification & ingestion enforcement (implement PHI scrubber and CI checks)  
  - Acceptance: Ingestion pipeline enforces de-id; CI contains automated PHI tests scanning examples/data; test dataset includes de‑identified/synthetic examples.  
  - Effort: 5–10 days.  
  - Dependencies: data ingestion code (src/aimedres/integration, FHIR pipeline), docs/DATA_HANDLING_PROCEDURES.md, README.md notes on PHI scrubber.
- P0-4: Responsible vulnerability disclosure process enabled and documented  
  - Acceptance: Security contact configured (private GitHub vulnerability reporting or PGP key), SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md updated, contributors aware (CONTRIBUTING.md).  
  - Effort: 1 day.  
  - Dependencies: CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md, repo settings.
- P0-5: Human‑in‑loop gating enforced end‑to‑end (GUI + backend) with mandatory rationale logging  
  - Acceptance: GUI prevents finalizing high‑risk recommendations without clinician confirmation; every override creates an immutable audit entry. E2E test exists.  
  - Effort: 5 days.  
  - Dependencies: audit/logging backend (src/aimedres/security or security/blockchain_records), README safety notes.

P1 — High priority (early production / pilot)
- P1-1: Authentication & Authorization (OIDC/OAuth2, RBAC, MFA)  
  - Acceptance: OIDC integration (Keycloak/Auth0/etc.) or enterprise SSO works in staging; API enforces RBAC for clinician/researcher/admin roles; automated tests verify roles.  
  - Effort: 5 days.  
  - Dependencies: src/aimedres/security, docs/PHASE2B_README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md.
- P1-2: API contract (OpenAPI) and mock server for frontend development  
  - Acceptance: OpenAPI spec included in repo (docs or src/aimedres/api); mock server serves endpoints used by the GUI; CI validates spec against implementation.  
  - Effort: 2–4 days.  
  - Dependencies: docs/API_REFERENCE.md, src/aimedres/api.
- P1-3: Model serving endpoint(s) + versioning + model_card metadata  
  - Acceptance: Model inference endpoint supports model_version param; /model_card returns intended use, validation metrics, dataset provenance.  
  - Effort: 5–10 days.  
  - Dependencies: src/aimedres/training, model serving config, docs/MODEL_CARD (if present).
- P1-4: Explainability & uncertainty API endpoints  
  - Acceptance: Per-case explanations (feature attributions, uncertainty/confidence) available and documented; GUI consumes them and renders clearly.  
  - Effort: 5 days.  
  - Dependencies: explainability backend (README mentions explainability dashboard backend).
- P1-5: Minimal clinician UI (React + TypeScript) — Login, Case List, Case Detail, Explainability panel, Human-in-loop controls  
  - Acceptance: Frontend connected to mock API; E2E tests (Cypress) for primary flows; accessible components.  
  - Effort: 10–15 days.  
  - Dependencies: OpenAPI spec, frontend tooling.
- P1-6: Immutable audit logging & export (append-only ledger or blockchain_records module)  
  - Acceptance: All user actions, model inferences and overrides logged with timestamps, user, model_version, and de‑identified inputs; exportable for compliance.  
  - Effort: 7–10 days.  
  - Dependencies: security/blockchain_records.py, src/aimedres/security, docs/PHASE2B_README.md.
- P1-7: FHIR integration (sandbox/test, read-only for pilot)  
  - Acceptance: GUI can fetch mock/sandbox FHIR patients and populate case view; consent enforcement applied prior to showing sensitive data.  
  - Effort: 5–8 days.  
  - Dependencies: FHIR ingestion pipeline (README mentions FHIR ingestion), integration tests.
- P1-8: Basic performance baseline & load test scripts  
  - Acceptance: Documented latency SLOs and load tests in repo; staging environment meets target p50/p95 for pilot.

MVP (minimum to run small internal clinician/researcher pilot)
- Complete: P0-1, P0-2, P0-3, P0-5, P1-1, P1-2, P1-3, P1-4, P1-5, P1-6, P1-7, P2-1, P2-2
- Estimated team & timeline: 1 frontend, 1 backend, 1 ML, 1 security/ops → ~8–12 weeks (includes clinical UAT and remediation).

Suggested Epics / Issue grouping
- Epic: GUI MVP — issues: auth integration, OpenAPI spec, mock server, case list view, case detail + explainability, human-in-loop gating, E2E tests.
- Epic: Privacy & Data Handling — issues: PHI scrubber implementation, CI PHI scans, data retention policy, sample dataset de‑id.
- Epic: Security & Compliance — issues: audit ledger, OIDC, pen test, vulnerability disclosure.
- Epic: Model Ops — issues: versioned model service, model_card endpoint, inference monitoring.

Acceptance & release gating for pilot
- All P0 items completed and signed off (legal, PHI scrubber, responsible disclosure, human gating).
- All P1 items implemented, tested and pass clinician UAT in staging.
- Pen test completed and critical issues remediated.
- Deploy/runbook, rollback, incident response and SLOs documented (RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).

Repository locations to examine during implementation (examples)
- CONTRIBUTING.md — contributor and medical guidelines (clinical validation, privacy)  
- README.md — project features, PHI notes, explainability, FHIR pipeline references  
- docs/PHASE2B_README.md — security modules & quick start for Zero‑Trust / quantum crypto / blockchain records  
- docs/roadmap.md & docs/archive/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_P8B_P9.md — regulatory/pilot status and implementation notes  
- src/aimedres/api, src/aimedres/clinical, src/aimedres/security, src/aimedres/integration — primary code areas to inspect  
- tests/ (unit/test_security, performance) — baseline tests & examples  
- RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md — pre-release gating items to follow

Notes and cautions
- Several features are documented as “planned” or “in progress” (immutable audit trail, PHI scrubber, bias dashboards). Before relying on them, confirm code is implemented and tested in the repo (search for actual module files and tests — e.g., security/blockchain_records.py appears referenced in docs).  
- License inconsistency: README badge shows MIT, setup.py metadata lists Apache — pick and confirm authoritative LICENSE file before distribution.  
- Even if docs indicate “P8B: Clinical Pilot Programs — complete” or other archive notes say implementation complete, verify the actual code and tests are present and passing in your branch.
