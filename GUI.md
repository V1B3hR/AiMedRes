# GUI Implementation Checklist — Prioritized (Repository‑aware)

Version: 2025-10-24 (Phase 2 Complete)  
Author: GitHub Copilot for V1B3hR/AiMedRes

Purpose
- This file is a prioritized, actionable implementation checklist to build a clinician/researcher‑facing GUI for AiMedRes.
- It is based on a repository‑level analysis (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/, security modules, Phase2B docs, roadmap and archive docs, tests and project structure).
- Each item has: short description, acceptance criteria, rough effort estimate, and repository dependencies (files/dirs to inspect or link to).

How to use
- Create one GitHub issue per checklist item and link the relevant dependency files.
- Use acceptance criteria as gates for PR review and staging signoff.
- Track progress with Epics (see Suggested Epics section).

PRIORITY KEYS
- P0: Blocker — must be finished before any clinical pilot or user‑facing deployment
- P1: High — required for safe early production / constrained pilot
- P2: Medium — reliability, monitoring, compliance features for broader rollout
- P3: Low / Long‑term — advanced features and research integrations

Summary of repository signals used
- Contributor & process docs: CONTRIBUTING.md (clinical, security, PR templates)
- Security & privacy: docs/PHASE2B_README.md, SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md (referenced in docs/INDEX.md), security/ modules
- Regulatory & pilot state: docs/roadmap.md, docs/archive/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_P8B_P9.md, RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md
- APIs & code layout: src/aimedres/api, src/aimedres/clinical, src/aimedres/security, docs/API_REFERENCE.md (referenced)
- Tests: tests/unit/test_security, tests integration harness (referenced)

Repository locations to examine during implementation (examples)
- CONTRIBUTING.md — contributor and medical guidelines (clinical validation, privacy)  
- README.md — project features, PHI notes, explainability, FHIR pipeline references  
- docs/PHASE2B_README.md — security modules & quick start for Zero‑Trust / quantum crypto / blockchain records  
- docs/roadmap.md & docs/archive/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_P8B_P9.md — regulatory/pilot status and implementation notes  
- src/aimedres/api, src/aimedres/clinical, src/aimedres/security, src/aimedres/integration — primary code areas to inspect  
- tests/ (unit/test_security, performance) — baseline tests & examples  
- RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md — pre-release gating items to follow

Notes and cautions
- Several features are documented as “planned” or “in progress” (immutable audit trail, PHI scrubber, bias dashboards). Before relying on them, confirm code is implemented and tested in the repo (search for actual module files and tests — e.g., security/blockchain_records.py appears referenced in docs).  
- License inconsistency: README badge shows MIT, setup.py metadata lists Apache — pick and confirm authoritative LICENSE file before distribution.  
- Even if docs indicate “P8B: Clinical Pilot Programs — complete” or other archive notes say implementation complete, verify the actual code and tests are present and passing in your branch.
