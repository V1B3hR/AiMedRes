# duetmind_adaptive

**duetmind_adaptive** is a hybrid AI framework that combines Adaptive Neural Networks (AdaptiveNN) with DuetMind cognitive agents. AdaptiveNN provides the "brain"—dynamic, learning, biologically inspired neural networks—while DuetMind supplies the "mind"—reasoning, safety, and social interaction. Together they create truly adaptive, safe, multi-agent systems with emergent intelligence.

## Project Description

This project aims to develop living AI agents that possess:
- **Energy and Sleep Cycles:** Each agent simulates biological states such as energy and sleep, affecting its reasoning and performance.
- **Emergent Reasoning:** Agents' thought processes adapt dynamically based on internal neural network states.
- **Multi-Agent Dialogues:** Agents interact with each other, engaging in conversations and joint reasoning tasks.
- **Safety Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of "biological" neural processes to ensure safe operation.
- **Memory Consolidation:** Agents consolidate memory during sleep phases, influencing future reasoning and behavior.

Unlike conventional AI, duetmind_adaptive creates cognitive agents whose reasoning engines are living, adaptive neural networks—resulting in “living, breathing, sleeping” brains.

## System Architecture

The architecture is composed of two major components:

1. **AdaptiveNN ("Brain")**
    - Dynamic neural nodes with energy, sleep, and mood states
    - Learning and adaptation over time
    - Biological process monitoring

2. **DuetMind ("Mind")**
    - Reasoning engine and dialogue management
    - Safety and social interaction modules
    - Memory consolidation and retrieval
