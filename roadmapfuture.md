---

## Foundation & Core System
- âœ… Adaptive neural network architecture designed
- âœ… Multi-agent dialogue framework implemented
- âœ… Basic biological state simulation (energy, sleep, mood)
- âœ… Initial Alzheimer's dataset integration
- âœ… Project structure reorganization (`files/training/` migration)
- âœ… Stable core architecture with optimized performance
- âœ… Documentation overhaul with updated examples

## Core Infrastructure & Import Paths
- ðŸŸ§ Import path migration to `files.training.*` (95% complete)
- ðŸŸ§ Core engine stabilization (Performance target: <100ms, currently ~150ms)
- ðŸŸ§ Training pipeline enhancement (Alzheimer's data preprocessing, validation framework, cross-validation protocol)

## Clinical Integration & Validation
- ðŸŸ§ EHR integration protocol finalization
- ðŸŸ§ FHIR/HL7 standard implementation and compliance
- ðŸŸ§ Explainable AI dashboard deployment
- ðŸŸ§ Real-time patient monitoring system
- ðŸŸ¥ Initial clinical pilot programs
- ðŸŸ¥ Regulatory compliance documentation

## Production Deployment & Scale
- ðŸŸ¥ FDA regulatory pathway initiation
- ðŸŸ¥ Multi-hospital clinical validation
- ðŸŸ¥ Advanced AI safety monitoring
- ðŸŸ¥ Production infrastructure scaling
- ðŸŸ¥ Research publication and dissemination

## Advanced Features & Research
- ðŸŸ¦ Python version inconsistency (pyproject.toml vs setup.py) â€“ needs alignment
- ðŸŸ¦ Package name standardization (`duetmind-adaptive` vs `duetmind_adaptive`)
- ðŸŸ¥ Expanded disease coverage (Parkinson's, ALS, etc.)
- âœ… Advanced memory consolidation algorithms
- ðŸŸ¥ 3D brain visualization tools
- ðŸŸ¥ Custom agent behavior API
- ðŸŸ¥ Mobile clinical companion app
- ðŸŸ¥ Drug discovery and clinical trial support modules

## Testing, Documentation, & Contributions
- âœ… Comprehensive pytest test suite present
- ðŸŸ§ Ongoing test/data expansion and validation
- âœ… GitHub Issues and PR workflow enabled for bugs and enhancements
- âœ… Contributing docs for code, documentation, and testing
