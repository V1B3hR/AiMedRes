## Migration Notes

### File Structure Updates 

**Important**: The project file structure has been reorganized. If you have existing code that imports from the old paths, please update your imports:

#### Updated Import Paths:
- **Old**: `from training.alzheimer_training_system import ...`
- **New**: `from files.training.alzheimer_training_system import ...`

#### Files Updated:
- Training modules are now located in `files/training/` directory
- All references to `training.*` imports have been updated to `files.training.*`
- Documentation and examples have been updated with correct import paths

#### For Developers:
If you encounter import errors like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'training.alzheimer_training_system'`, update your imports to use the new path structure:

```python
# Old import (will fail)
from training.alzheimer_training_system import load_alzheimer_data

# New import (correct)
from files.training.alzheimer_training_system import load_alzheimer_data
```
