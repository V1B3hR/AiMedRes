# 🛡️ AimMedRes – Security & Compliance Roadmap (Updated December 2024)

## Summary: All critical security, encryption, authentication, audit logging, and compliance requirements are implemented and tested as described. All major development tasks completed December 2024.

---

## ✅ Completed Foundation
- [x] Core adaptive neural network architecture
- [x] Multi-agent dialogue framework skeleton
- [x] Basic biological state simulation models
- [x] Initial Alzheimer's dataset integration
- [x] Project structure reorganization (`files/training/` migration)

## ✅ Critical Gaps Resolved
- [✅] **Security Vulnerability:** Comprehensive medical data encryption framework implemented and tested (AES-256 + RSA hybrid)
- [✅] **Compliance Gap:** HIPAA audit logger fully implemented with real-time monitoring and audit trails
- [✅] **Performance Bottleneck:** Target <100ms achieved with GPU acceleration and optimization (`OptimizedAdaptiveEngine`)
- [✅] **GDPR Data Handler:** Complete implementation with EU compliance features (`gdpr_data_handler.py`)
- [✅] **FDA Documentation:** Complete implementation with 510(k) and De Novo pathway support (`fda_documentation.py`)
- [✅] **Safety Risk:** AI decision validation/human oversight protocols implemented with clinical workflow integration
- [✅] **Data Integrity:** Enhanced de-identification engine with advanced anonymization complete (k-anonymity, l-diversity, differential privacy)
- [✅] **Regulatory Readiness:** FDA pre-submission documentation framework complete with comprehensive test suite

## Phase 1A: Security & Compliance (Oct-Dec 2025)
- ✅ Security assessment, encryption, authentication, compliance modules all implemented and tested (see `security.md`, `docs/SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md`)
- ✅ Medical-grade encryption: AES-256 + RSA hybrid implemented, model weight protection, agent communication encryption, device attestation
- ✅ HIPAA audit logger: action tracking, role-based access control, immutable audit trails

## Phase 1B: Clinical Security Integration
- ✅ De-identification & anonymization engine: comprehensive GDPR-compliant privacy management implemented
- ✅ Patient data protection protocols: encryption, RBAC, audit logging, and secure processing complete

## AI Safety & Validation Framework
- ✅ Clinical decision validation, human-in-loop, confidence scoring implemented and tested
- [✅] Advanced features: bias detection and adversarial testing frameworks implemented and operational

## Military-Grade Platform & Threat Protection
- [ ] Zero-trust architecture, quantum-security, blockchain integrity planned
- [ ] Advanced threat detection/response in planning; core monitoring implemented

## Regulatory Compliance Automation
- ✅ FDA, EU MDR, ISO standards: comprehensive documentation frameworks implemented with automated generation
- [✅] Advanced automation features and multi-regional compliance templates implemented and operational

## Clinical Validation & Integration
- ✅ EHR integration with security: FHIR/HL7 encryption, OAuth2, SMART on FHIR, consent verification implemented and operational

---

## Documentation & Test Coverage
- ✅ Security documentation (see `docs/SECURITY_ASSESSMENT.md`, `security.md`)
- ✅ Comprehensive security test suite present
- ✅ Full audit trail and penetration testing results documented

---

## Completed Security Implementation
- ✅ Security audit completed - comprehensive framework operational
- ✅ Emergency encryption, HIPAA logging, secure dev environment, incident response, backup/recovery, load balancing all implemented
