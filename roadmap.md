# DuetMind Adaptive Roadmap

1.Foundation & Extensibility
- **Refactor Core Modules:** Further modularize codebase for plug-and-play ML agents and medical domains.
- **Expand Documentation:** Add detailed how-to guides (setup, data sources, pipeline extension, simulation scenarios).
- **Improve API Coverage:** Expand REST API endpoints for dashboard, data uploads, agent settings, and real-time metrics.
- **Testing & QA:** Increase coverage of regression, integration, and performance tests; add more synthetic and real-world test data.

2. Multi-Modality & Agents
- **Medical Imaging Expansion:** Integrate support for additional imaging formats (PET, CT). Add new preprocessing and feature extraction modules.
- **Multi-Agent Enhancements:** Implement agent-to-agent communication protocols. Add explainability and safety checks for agent decisions.
- **Clinical Scenario Builder:** Enhance scenario builder to support longitudinal patient data, comorbidities, and complex interventions.
- **Federated Learning:** Prototype federated and privacy-preserving training across multiple simulated institutions.

3. Automation & Scalability
- **AutoML Integration:** Add support for hyperparameter search, model selection, and transfer learning via AutoML frameworks.
- **Pipeline Customization:** Template-based pipeline generator for new medical domains (e.g., cardiovascular, oncology).
- **Scalable Orchestration:** Integrate Ray or Dask for distributed simulation and model training.
- **Drift & Monitoring:** Expand drift detection to include concept drift, outlier detection, and automated alerting.

4. Production & Impact
- **Deployment Toolkit:** Provide CLI and UI tools for model deployment, rollback, and A/B testing in production environments.
- **User Experience:** Polish dashboard UI/UX, add real-time visualization, scenario playback, and intervention replay.
- **Community Contributions:** Create guidelines and templates for external contributors; host example projects.
- **Clinical Validation:** Collaborate with domain experts for real-world scenario validation and benchmarking.

## Ongoing: Maintenance & Iteration
- **Bug Fixes & Stability:** Address open issues and feedback promptly.
- **Performance Optimization:** Profile and optimize for speed, memory, and scalability.
- **Documentation Updates:** Keep all docs, guides, and API references up to date.
- **Security & Compliance:** Regular audits for data privacy, compliance, and safety.
