# AiMedRes Debugging Process: Phases & Best Practices

Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step debugging process tailored for the AiMedRes repository, with up to 10 phases. This plan integrates best practices for debugging AI/ML systems, including cross-validation, model visualization, hyperparameter tuning, code verification, and more.

  - Found 0 syntax errors, 0 import errors
  - Identified 3612 logical issues (mostly debug prints and warnings)
  - All files compile successfully
- **Subphase 3.2:** Confirm correct use of ML libraries and APIs ✅ COMPLETE

  - Identified 88 API usage issues (missing random_state, potential data leakage)
  - Validated proper ML workflow patterns
  - No critical API misuse detected
- **Subphase 3.3:** Validate utility functions (feature engineering, data splitting) ✅ COMPLETE
  - Found 20 utility files with specialized functions
  - Identified 50 function quality issues (missing docstrings, type hints)
  - Found 63 data splitting issues (mainly missing random_state parameters)
  - All utility functions are syntactically correct and functional

## PHASE 4: MODEL ARCHITECTURE VERIFICATION ✅ COMPLETE
- **Subphase 4.1:** Ensure model architecture matches problem needs (avoid under/overfitting) ✅ COMPLETE
  - Implemented comprehensive architecture analysis
  - Data characteristics evaluation (samples-to-features ratio, class balance)
  - Overfitting risk factor identification
  - Architecture recommendations based on data properties
- **Subphase 4.2:** Start with simple models for baseline (e.g., linear regression, decision tree) ✅ COMPLETE
  - Implemented baseline models: LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier  
  - Cross-validation evaluation with overfitting detection
  - Performance logging and comparison
- **Subphase 4.3:** Gradually increase complexity, logging performance changes ✅ COMPLETE
  - Progressive complexity models: RandomForest (simple→complex), SVM (linear→RBF), MLP (simple→complex)
  - Performance tracking across complexity levels
  - Overfitting detection and warnings
  - Comprehensive visualizations and recommendations

## PHASE 5: CROSS-VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION ✅ COMPLETE
- **Subphase 5.1:** Use k-fold cross-validation for generalization check ✅ COMPLETE
- **Subphase 5.2:** Apply stratified sampling for imbalanced datasets ✅ COMPLETE
- **Subphase 5.3:** Optionally, use leave-one-out cross-validation for small datasets ✅ COMPLETE

## PHASE 6: HYPERPARAMETER TUNING & SEARCH
- **Subphase 6.1:** Identify key hyperparameters for tuning (learning rate, batch size, etc.)
- **Subphase 6.2:** Use grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization for tuning
- **Subphase 6.3:** Track and visualize tuning results to identify optimal settings

## PHASE 7: MODEL TRAINING & EVALUATION
- **Subphase 7.1:** Train models with cross-validation
- **Subphase 7.2:** Record training, validation, and test metrics (accuracy, loss, etc.)
- **Subphase 7.3:** Compare results with baseline models

## PHASE 8: MODEL VISUALIZATION & INTERPRETABILITY
- **Subphase 8.1:** Generate feature importance plots for tree-based models
- **Subphase 8.2:** Plot partial dependence for key features
- **Subphase 8.3:** Display confusion matrices for classifiers (precision, recall, F1)

## PHASE 9: ERROR ANALYSIS & EDGE CASES
- **Subphase 9.1:** Analyze misclassified samples and residuals
- **Subphase 9.2:** Investigate model bias (e.g., toward certain classes)
- **Subphase 9.3:** Test on edge cases and adversarial examples

## PHASE 10: FINAL MODEL & SYSTEM VALIDATION
- **Subphase 10.1:** Validate model on held-out/test data
- **Subphase 10.2:** Perform end-to-end pipeline tests
- **Subphase 10.3:** Document findings, improvements, and next steps
