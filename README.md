AdaptiveNN provides the "brain" - dynamic, learning, biological DuetMind provides the "mind" - reasoning, safety, social interaction.
Together they create truly adaptive, safe, multi-agent systems with emergent intelligence


The Result:

Living AI agents that actually have energy, sleep cycles, and moods
Emergent reasoning - their thinking changes based on network state
Multi-agent dialogues between different neural networks
Safety monitoring of the biological processes
Memory consolidation during sleep phases affects future reasoning

It's not just using one or the other - it's a true hybrid where your adaptive neural nodes ARE the reasoning engine for DuetMind's cognitive agents. 
The agents literally have living, breathing, sleeping neural networks as their brains!
