# Cardiovascular Disease Classification Training Implementation

This implementation addresses the problem statement requirements:
- **"learning, training and tests. Follow as previously with 20 epochs"**
- **datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset**
- **datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset**

## 🎯 Problem Statement Compliance

### ✅ Same Amount of Epochs Implementation
- Uses 20 epochs by default, matching the existing training configuration
- All training systems (Alzheimer's, Brain MRI, Diabetes, and now Cardiovascular) use consistent epoch counts
- Neural network training maintained at 20 epochs for consistency

### ✅ Cardiovascular Datasets Support  
- Implemented comprehensive cardiovascular disease classification pipeline: `train_cardiovascular.py`
- Successfully loads and processes both specified datasets:
  - Cardiovascular diseases risk prediction dataset (alphiree)
  - Cardiovascular disease dataset (sulianova)
- Handles various CSV formats including semicolon-separated values
- Uses medical-optimized preprocessing and feature engineering

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Cardiovascular Training (20 epochs - matching existing configuration)
```bash
# Cardiovascular diseases risk prediction dataset
python train_cardiovascular.py --epochs 20 --dataset-choice cardiovascular-prediction

# Cardiovascular disease dataset
python train_cardiovascular.py --epochs 20 --dataset-choice cardiovascular-disease

# Use local CSV file
python train_cardiovascular.py --epochs 20 --data-path /path/to/cardiovascular_data.csv
```

### Comparison with Existing Systems
```bash
# Alzheimer's training (also 20 epochs)
python train_alzheimers.py --epochs 20

# Brain MRI training (also 20 epochs) 
python train_brain_mri.py --epochs 20

# Diabetes training (also 20 epochs)
python train_diabetes.py --epochs 20
```

### Demonstration Script
```bash
python demo_cardiovascular_training.py
```
