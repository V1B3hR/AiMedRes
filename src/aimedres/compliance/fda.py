FDA Documentation Module for Regulatory Submission

Comprehensive FDA documentation generation and validation system for medical AI devices.
Implements FDA guidelines for Software as Medical Device (SaMD) and AI/ML-enabled devices
including 510(k) submissions, De Novo pathways, and PMA requirements.

Critical Features:
- Automated 510(k) submission package generation
- Software documentation per FDA guidance
- Clinical validation evidence compilation
- Risk analysis and mitigation documentation
- Predicate device comparison analysis
- Pre-submission consultation materials
- Post-market surveillance planning
