## Key Observations

1. **Model Performance**: All models achieved similar accuracy (~81%), indicating consistent performance across different algorithms
2. **Early Stopping**: Neural network training stopped early at epoch 13 (best at epoch 6), demonstrating effective convergence detection
3. **Class Imbalance**: The dataset shows significant class imbalance (79.62% disease prevalence), which is reflected in the balanced accuracy (63.05%) being lower than regular accuracy
4. **Feature Engineering**: The preprocessing pipeline successfully handled both numeric and categorical features with proper scaling and encoding

## Recommendations

1. **Class Imbalance**: Consider using class weights or resampling techniques to address the imbalanced dataset
2. **Feature Selection**: Analyze feature importance to potentially reduce dimensionality
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Perform grid search or Bayesian optimization for better model performance
4. **Real Dataset**: When Kaggle credentials are available, retrain with actual cardiovascular disease datasets for production use

## Technical Details

- **Python Version**: 3.12.3
- **Key Dependencies**: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, torch
- **Training Time**: ~7 seconds (sample data)
- **Output Directory**: `cardiovascular_training_output/`
