### Third-Party License Review

The following dependencies and their licenses have been reviewed for GPL-3.0 compatibility:

#### Core Dependencies (from requirements.txt)
- **NumPy**: BSD-3-Clause ✅ (Compatible)
- **Pandas**: BSD-3-Clause ✅ (Compatible)
- **Scikit-learn**: BSD-3-Clause ✅ (Compatible)
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Apache-2.0 ✅ (Compatible)
- **Matplotlib**: PSF-based ✅ (Compatible)

**Note**: GPL-3.0 is compatible with most open-source licenses for dependencies. The GPL-3.0 applies to the AiMedRes codebase itself and any derivative works, but not to separately distributed dependencies.

### Legal Review Tracking

**Issue**: #[TBD] - Legal team final signoff on GPL-3.0 licensing
**Assigned to**: Legal/Compliance Team
**Status**: Pending
**Priority**: P0

### Action Items

- [ ] Obtain legal team signoff on GPL-3.0 choice (tracked in issue)
- [ ] Review any contributor agreements for GPL-3.0 compatibility
- [ ] Establish process for license compatibility review for new dependencies
- [ ] Document license grant process for commercial licensing inquiries

### Distribution Terms

**AiMedRes GPL-3.0 Distribution Terms:**

1. **Source Code Availability**: Source code must be made available when distributing binaries
2. **License Preservation**: LICENSE file must be included in all distributions
3. **Modification Notice**: Modified versions must be clearly marked as changed
4. **Copyleft**: Derivative works must also be GPL-3.0 licensed
5. **No Additional Restrictions**: Cannot add additional restrictions beyond GPL-3.0 terms
6. **Patent Grant**: GPL-3.0 includes patent grant provisions (Section 11)

### Commercial Use and Dual Licensing

**Note**: While GPL-3.0 allows commercial use, some organizations may require alternative licensing:

- GPL-3.0 permits commercial use and distribution
- Modifications and derivative works must remain open source under GPL-3.0
- For proprietary/closed-source uses, dual licensing arrangements would need to be negotiated separately
- Contact maintainers for discussions about alternative licensing arrangements
